A GUI-Based Ceaser Cipher Application  

**Description**  
Application designed to demonstrate the encryption and decryption of messages using a Caesar cipher. Built with Python and the `tkinter` library, this project provides a visual and interactive way for users to encrypt a secrete message. Users can encrypt messages, decrypt them, generate random keys, and display both encrypted and decrypted outputs side by side.  

**Purpose and Objectives**  
- To provide a hands-on demonstration of Caesar cipher encryption.  
- To offer an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing GUI for cryptography enthusiasts.  
- To practice and showcase collaborative development in Python GUI programming.
