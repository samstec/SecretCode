This Python script was developed collaboratively by a group of three. It creates a graphical user interface (GUI) application using the `tkinter` library. The application allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using a Caesar cipher. Here's a summary:

Features:
1. **Input Fields**:
   - Allows users to input a secret message and a cipher key.
   - Displays encrypted and decrypted messages in designated fields.
   - Provides fields to show both encrypted and decrypted messages side by side.

2. **Buttons**:
   - **Encrypt**: Encrypts the input message using the specified key.
   - **Decrypt**: Displays the original input message as a "decryption."
   - **Random Key**: Generates a random integer key for encryption.
   - **Show Both**: Displays both encrypted and decrypted messages side by side.
   - **Self-Destruct**: Closes the application.

3. **Encryption Logic**:
   - Implements the Caesar cipher by rotating letters in the alphabet based on the provided key. Utilizes `deque` for efficient letter shifting.

4. **Styling**:
   - Styled with a red and black theme and uses the "Papyrus" font for aesthetic appeal.

This project highlights collaboration and teamwork while demonstrating skills in GUI development, encryption techniques, and event-driven programming in Python.
